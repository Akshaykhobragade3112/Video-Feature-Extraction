# 🎥 Video Feature Extraction Tool 

This project is a Python-based tool that extracts key **visual** and **temporal** features from local video files using computer vision and deep learning techniques.

It was built as part of the **White Panda Machine Learning Engineer assignment**, focusing on core video analysis without relying on OCR.

## 🚀 Features Extracted

The tool processes videos and computes the following three features:

### 1️⃣ Shot Cut Detection
- Detects **"hard cuts"** between scenes using histogram difference between consecutive frames.
- Helps identify transitions or scene changes in a video.

### 2️⃣ Motion Analysis
- Measures **average motion** in the video using **Optical Flow (Farneback method)**.
- Quantifies how much the content in the video is moving overall.

### 3️⃣ Object vs. Person Ratio
- Uses a pre-trained **YOLOv8** model to detect and classify people vs other objects.
- Calculates the **ratio of people to objects** across sampled frames:
